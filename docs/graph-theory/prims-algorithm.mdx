# Prim's Algorithm

> Prim's Algorithm is a greedy algorithm that builds the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) for a graph by starting from an arbitrary vertex and growing the MST one edge at a time

MST is a _subset_ of the graph that connects **ALL** vertices together, _without_ any cycles, and with the _minimum_ possible total edge weight

Prim's begins with a single vertex (arbitrarily chosen) and gradually adds the `least expensive edge` that connects a vertex in the growing MST to a vertex outside it.

A heap (Priority Queue) is used to _efficiently_ retrieve the `least expensive edge` that connects the MST to a new vertex.

`heapq` always pops() the edge with the smallest weight that connects the growing `MST` to any unvisited vertex

```python title="prims/graph.py"
graph = {
    0: {1: 2, 3: 6},
    1: {0: 2, 2: 3, 3: 8, 4: 5},
    2: {1: 3, 4: 7},
    3: {0: 6, 1: 8, 4: 9},
    4: {1: 5, 2: 7, 3: 9}
}
```

Maintain a heap/priority queue called `edges`.

```python
import heapq
mst = [] # Store MST edges
start = 0 # From vertex 0
visited = set([start])
edges = [(cost, start, to) for to, cost in graph[start].items()]
heapq.heapify(edges)
```

```python
while edges:
    cost, frm, to = heapq.heappop(edges)
    if to not in visited:
        visited.add(to)
        mst.append((frm, to, cost))
        for to_next, cost in graph[to].items():
            if to_next not in visited:
                heapq.heappush(edges, (cost, to, to_next))
print(mst)
```
