# Kruskal's Algorithm

> Kruskal's Algorithm is a greedy algorithm that builds the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) for a graph by starting from an arbitrary vertex and growing the MST one edge at a time

Kruskal's algorithm is edge-centric rather than vertex-centric. It works by sorting all the edges by weight and then adding edges to the MST in order of increasing weight, provided they do not form a cycle. Since Kruskal's algorithm does not rely on a specific starting vertex, it doesn't require you to specify one.

Kruskal's explicitly checks for cycles using the `Union-Find` data structure (Disjoint Set), which tracks connected components and ensures that adding an edge does not create a cycle.

```python title="kruskals/graph.py"
graph = {
    0: {1: 2, 3: 6},
    1: {0: 2, 2: 3, 3: 8, 4: 5},
    2: {1: 3, 4: 7},
    3: {0: 6, 1: 8, 4: 9},
    4: {1: 5, 2: 7, 3: 9}
}
```

```python title="disjointset.py"
class DisjointSet:
    def __init__(self, vertices):
        self.parent = {v: v for v in vertices}
        self.rank = {v: 0 for v in vertices}

    def find(self, v):
        if self.parent[v] != v:
            self.parent[v] = self.find(self.parent[v])
        return self.parent[v]

    def union(self, v1, v2):
        root1 = self.find(v1)
        root2 = self.find(v2)

        if root1 != root2:
            if self.rank[root1] > self.rank[root2]:
                self.parent[root2] = root1
            else:
                self.parent[root1] = root2
                if self.rank[root1] == self.rank[root2]:
                    self.rank[root2] += 1
```
