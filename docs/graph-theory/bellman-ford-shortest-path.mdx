# Bellman-Ford Algorithm

> Bellan-Ford finds the shortest paths from a single source vertex to all other vertices in a graph, even when the graph has edges with negative weights

## Iteratively relaxing all edges in the graph

**Relaxation** means for each edge `(u, v)`, if the shortest _**known**_ distance to `v` is greater than the distance to `u` plus edge weight `(u, v)`, update the newly found shorter distance

## Graph and Algo

`graph[u][v]` gives the **weight** of the edge from vertex `u` to vertex `v`.

```python
graph = {
    0: {1: -1, 2: 4},
    1: {2: 3, 3: 2, 4: 2},
    2: {},
    3: {2: 5, 1: 1},
    4: {3: -3}
}
```

the `dist` dictionary holding the distances from the `start` node (vertex) is

```python
V = len(graph.keys())
start = 0
dist = { v: float('inf') for v in range(V)}
dist[start] = 0
print(dist)
```

```bash
{0: 0, 1: inf, 2: inf, 3: inf, 4: inf}
```

## Code

```python
for _ in range(V - 1):
    for u in graph:
        for v in graph[u]:
            if dist[u] != float('inf') and dist[u] + graph[u][v] < dist[v]:
                dist[v] = dist[u] + graph[u][v]
for u in graph:
    for v in graph[u]:
        if dist[u] != float('inf') and dist[u] + graph[u][v] < dist[v]:
            print("Graph contains a negative weight cycle")
```
